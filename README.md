# This Repository for showing results of studies, works & searches for my Graduation Project Topic "High Image Compression Ratio"

## after doing some seraches we agreed & prefered to use neural network to achieve this goal despite of the high complexity but the much better
predection and reconstruction in high fidility encourged us to go through this untraditional way considering there is alot of good and usable modern engineered codecs like JPG, JPEG & BPG the known traditional techniques. i think there's a coming revolution very soon in this topic of data"specificly image" compression using DL as there is already challenges by supervision of organizations like Google. The workshop this year will be part of CVPR2021 and will be entirely virtual. The conference will take place between June 19 and June 25.
